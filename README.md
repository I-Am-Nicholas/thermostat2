# THERMOSTAT - My Intro to JavaScript

## A JavaScript Thermostat Interface with HTML and a JQuery UI

## Future Features

- In the future I hope to add the ability for the user to set the range themselves, via the UI, rather than it being fixed as it is now.

- The gauge's colour will change according to the temperature.
